What is Sorting?
Sorting refers to rearrangement of a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure. Sorting means reordering of all the elements either in ascending or in descending order.

Applications of Sorting Algorithms:
Searching Algorithms: Sorting is often a crucial step in search algorithms like binary search and Ternary Search. A lot of Greedy Algorithms use sorting as a first step to apply Greedy Approach. For example Activity Selection, Fractional Knapsack, Weighted Job Scheduling, etc
Data management: Sorting data makes it easier to search, retrieve, and analyze. For example the order by operation in SQL queries requires sorting.
Database optimization: Sorting data in databases improves query performance. We preprocess the data by sorting so that efficient searching can be applied.
Machine learning: Sorting is used to prepare data for training machine learning models.
Data Analysis: Sorting helps in identifying patterns, trends, and outliers in datasets. It plays a vital role in statistical analysis, financial modeling, and other data-driven fields.
Operating Systems: Sorting algorithms are used in operating systems for tasks like task scheduling, memory management, and file system organization.

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with equal values maintain their relative order in the sorted output.

Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 

QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.
